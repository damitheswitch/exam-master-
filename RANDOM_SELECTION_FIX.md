# Random Question Selection Fix

## Problem
When pressing "Select Random" button in exam creation:
- If required fields are missing → Dialog closes with failure message
- If all fields are filled → Dialog closes with success message but no exam created

## Root Cause
The "Select Random" button was inside the `<form>` element, and despite having `type="button"` and `preventDefault()`, in some React/dialog contexts it was still triggering form submission.

## Solution
**Restructured the component layout:**

### Before:
```jsx
<form onSubmit={localSubmit}>
  <!-- All form fields -->
  <!-- Select Random button HERE (problematic) -->
  <!-- Question selection area -->
  <DialogFooter>
    <Button type="submit">Save Exam</Button>
  </DialogFooter>
</form>
```

### After:
```jsx
<div>
  <form onSubmit={localSubmit}>
    <!-- Only basic form fields (title, subject, duration, date) -->
  </form>
  
  <!-- Select Random button HERE (safe, outside form) -->
  <!-- Question selection area -->
  
  <DialogFooter>
    <Button type="button" onClick={localSubmit}>Save Exam</Button>
  </DialogFooter>
</div>
```

## Changes Made:
1. **Moved "Select Random" button outside the form** - Now it can't accidentally trigger form submission
2. **Split form structure** - Only core input fields are inside the `<form>` tag
3. **Changed Save button** - Now uses explicit onClick handler instead of form submission
4. **Added debugging** - Console logs to track form submission and validation

## Testing Steps:
1. Create new exam
2. Fill only "Subject" field (e.g., "math")
3. Click "Select Random" - Should show success message and stay in dialog
4. Fill remaining fields (title, date, duration)
5. Click "Save Exam" - Should create exam and close dialog

## Result:
✅ "Select Random" button now works correctly without closing the dialog
✅ Form validation works properly
✅ Exam creation works as expected
