# White Page Debug - Complete Setup

## üîç **Debugging Added:**

### **Both Pages Now Have:**
1. **Module Loading Logs** - Confirms if the component files are being loaded
2. **Component Initialization Logs** - Confirms if the React component is being instantiated
3. **User Context Logs** - Confirms if user authentication is working
4. **Data Loading Logs** - Confirms if localStorage data is being retrieved
5. **Render State Logs** - Shows what's happening during render
6. **Visual Debug Info** - Debug text visible on loading screens

## üß™ **Testing Process:**

### **Step 1: Check Module Loading**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to the problematic pages
3. **Look for these logs first:**
   - `=== STUDENT PERFORMANCE PAGE MODULE LOADED ===`
   - `=== TAKE EXAM PAGE MODULE LOADED ===`

**If you DON'T see these:** The component files aren't loading (import/build issue)
**If you DO see these:** Continue to Step 2

### **Step 2: Check Component Initialization**
**Look for:**
   - `=== STUDENT PERFORMANCE PAGE COMPONENT INITIALIZED ===`
   - `=== TAKE EXAM PAGE COMPONENT INITIALIZED ===`

**If you DON'T see these:** Component isn't being rendered (routing issue)
**If you DO see these:** Continue to Step 3

### **Step 3: Check User Context**
**Look for:**
   - `User object:` (should show user data, not null)
   - `User ID:` (should show user ID)

**If user is null:** Authentication/context issue
**If user is valid:** Continue to Step 4

### **Step 4: Check Data Loading**
**Look for:**
   - `Loading data from localStorage...`
   - `Performance page raw data:` / `All exams loaded:`
   - Data objects in console

**If data is empty/corrupted:** localStorage issue
**If data looks good:** Continue to Step 5

### **Step 5: Check Render Logic**
**Look for:**
   - `Performance page render - loading:` / `TakeExamPage render - exam:`
   - Loading states and conditions

## üéØ **Expected Console Output (Working):**

### **Performance Page:**
```
=== STUDENT PERFORMANCE PAGE MODULE LOADED ===
=== STUDENT PERFORMANCE PAGE COMPONENT INITIALIZED ===
=== PERFORMANCE PAGE USEEFFECT TRIGGERED ===
User object: {id: "...", role: "teacher", ...}
Loading data from localStorage...
Performance page raw data: {allSubmissions: [...], allExams: [...], ...}
Filtered data: {teacherExams: [...], teacherSubmissions: [...], ...}
Performance page render - loading: false, error: null, user: {...}
```

### **Take Exam Page:**
```
=== TAKE EXAM PAGE MODULE LOADED ===
=== TAKE EXAM PAGE COMPONENT INITIALIZED ===
=== TAKE EXAM PAGE USEEFFECT TRIGGERED ===
User ID: "student123"
Exam ID from params: "1748248312869"
Loading exam data from localStorage...
All exams loaded: 3
TakeExamPage: Found exam: {id: "1748248312869", title: "..."}
TakeExamPage: Selected questions: 5
TakeExamPage render - exam: {...}, questions.length: 5
```

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **White Page + No Console Logs:**
- **Issue:** Component file not loading
- **Solution:** Check file path, import syntax, build errors

### **Module Loaded + No Component Init:**
- **Issue:** Routing problem
- **Solution:** Check route configuration, protected routes

### **Component Init + No User:**
- **Issue:** Authentication context problem
- **Solution:** Check login state, AuthContext provider

### **All Logs + Still Loading Forever:**
- **Issue:** State update problem
- **Solution:** Check useState/useEffect dependencies

## üìã **Next Steps:**
Run both problematic pages and share the console output. Based on where the logs stop, we'll know exactly what's broken and how to fix it!
