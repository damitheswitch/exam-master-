## ðŸ”§ **Fix #1: "Select Random" Button Issue - RESOLVED**
**Problem:** Clicking "Select Random" in exam creation would close the window without creating the exam.

**Root Cause:** Button inside form was triggering form submission.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent form submission
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages and validation
- File Modified: `front-end/src/components/TeacherAdmin/ExamForm.jsx`

**How to Test:**
1. Create new exam as teacher
2. Enter subject, title, date
3. Set number of random questions
4. Click "Select Random" - window should stay open and questions should be selected

## ðŸ”§ **Fix #2: Question Import Override Issue - RESOLVED**
**Problem:** Importing new question files would replace existing questions instead of adding to them.

**Root Cause:** Import function was replacing instead of merging questions.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added duplicate detection based on question text and subject
- Questions now merge instead of replace
- Added feedback showing import results vs duplicates skipped
- File Modified: `front-end/src/pages/TeacherAdmin/QuestionManagementPage.jsx`

**How to Test:**
1. Import questions from history-qst.json
2. Import questions from math-qst.json
3. Verify both sets are present in question bank
4. Check feedback messages about duplicates

## ðŸ”§ **Fix #3: Early Exam Access Prevention - RESOLVED**
**Problem:** Students could access exams before scheduled time, showing blank pages.

**Root Cause:** TakeExamPage only checked if exam was published, not timing.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive time validation in TakeExamPage
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Improved loading states with helpful messages
- Better error messages explaining when exams will be available
- File Modified: `front-end/src/pages/Student/TakeExamPage.jsx`

**How to Test:**
1. Create exam with future scheduled time
2. Log in as student
3. Try accessing exam before time - should see proper error message

## ðŸ”§ **Fix #4: Exam Button Unclickability - RESOLVED**
**Problem:** Disabled exam buttons were still clickable due to AlertDialog.

**Root Cause:** AlertDialog wrapper still triggered even on disabled buttons.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Conditionally render AlertDialog only when exam is available
- Show informative button with countdown when exam not available
- Added toast notification when clicking unavailable exams
- File Modified: `front-end/src/pages/Student/AvailableExamsPage.jsx`

**How to Test:**
1. View exams as student
2. Unavailable exams should show countdown and not be clickable
3. Available exams should allow starting with confirmation dialog

## ðŸ”§ **Fix #5: Removed Test Login Buttons - RESOLVED**
**Problem:** Test login buttons shouldn't be in production.

**Solution Implemented:**

- File Modified: `front-end/src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.jsx`
