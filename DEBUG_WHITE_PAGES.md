# Debug White Pages Issue

## Issues Identified:
1. **Performance Page** (`/teacher/performance`) - Shows white page
2. **Take Exam Page** (`/student/exam/:examId`) - Shows white page

## Changes Made for Debugging:
1. **Added extensive console logging** to both pages
2. **Added debug information** visible on loading screens
3. **Enhanced error tracking** in useEffect hooks

## Testing Steps:

### Test Performance Page:
1. Login as teacher/admin
2. Navigate to Performance page (`/teacher/performance`)
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for these console messages:
   - `=== PERFORMANCE PAGE USEEFFECT TRIGGERED ===`
   - `User object:` (should show user data)
   - `Loading data from localStorage...`
   - `Performance page raw data:`

### Test Take Exam Page:
1. Login as student
2. Go to Available Exams page
3. Click on any exam (or navigate directly to `/student/exam/[examId]`)
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Look for these console messages:
   - `=== TAKE EXAM PAGE USEEFFECT TRIGGERED ===`
   - `User ID:` and `Exam ID from params:`
   - `Loading exam data from localStorage...`
   - `All exams loaded:` (number)
   - `TakeExamPage: Found exam:` (exam object or null)

## Expected Behaviors:

### If Working Correctly:
- Console shows data loading successfully
- Page renders content after brief loading

### If Stuck in Loading:
- Page shows spinning loader with debug info
- Console shows where the loading gets stuck

### If White Page:
- No console logs appear
- Indicates component isn't mounting or there's a critical error

## Common Causes:
1. **User context not available** - User object is null/undefined
2. **Route parameters missing** - examId not passed correctly
3. **Data loading issues** - localStorage data corrupted or missing
4. **Component crash** - JavaScript error preventing render

## Next Steps:
Based on console output, we'll identify:
- Is it a data loading issue?
- Is it a user authentication issue?
- Is it a routing issue?
- Is it a component crash?
