# Testing Random Selection Fix

## Changes Made:
1. **Completely removed `<form>` element** - No form submission possible
2. **Replaced toast notifications with alerts** - To test if toast was causing dialog closure
3. **Added extensive debugging** - Console logs to track what's happening

## Testing Steps:

### Test 1: Basic Random Selection
1. Open exam creation dialog
2. **Only fill in "Subject"** field (e.g., "math")
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Click "Select Random"
5. **Expected:** 
   - Dialog stays open ✅
   - Alert shows "No questions found..." OR questions get selected
   - Console shows detailed logs

### Test 2: With Questions Available
1. Make sure you have questions in your question bank for the subject
2. Fill in "Subject" field
3. Click "Select Random"
4. **Expected:**
   - Dialog stays open ✅
   - Questions get checked in the list below
   - Console shows success logs

### Test 3: Complete Workflow
1. Fill in Subject → Click "Select Random" → Fill remaining fields → Click "Save Exam"
2. **Expected:**
   - Random selection works and stays in dialog
   - Only "Save Exam" button should close dialog and create exam

## Debug Information to Check:
- Look for `=== RANDOM SELECTION STARTED ===` and `=== RANDOM SELECTION COMPLETED ===` in console
- Look for `=== SAVE EXAM BUTTON CLICKED ===` - this should only appear when you click Save
- If you see unexpected "SAVE EXAM BUTTON CLICKED" logs, that means something is accidentally calling the save function

## If Dialog Still Closes:
The issue might be in the parent component or the UI library itself. We'll need to investigate further.

## Next Steps:
Once we confirm the random selection works, we'll re-enable proper toast notifications.
